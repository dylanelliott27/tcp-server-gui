# IF YOU HAVE ISSUES RUNNING
I ran into many problems trying to get JavaFX linked with my version of JDK (15).

I didn't read extremely in-depth into why but something to do with the newer version requiring you to manually import some things (fxml, etc)

If it requires you to import the javaFX to the project structure yourself, make sure the src.zip does not get included. (although you shouldn't have to, I included it in this repo).

If it still doesn't run, you may need to follow this https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/#install-javafx and add the require module line to your .vmoptions in intellij.

If still no... please let me know before marking as it does work on my computer, and I can either build a executable or film a video of the program working for you.
